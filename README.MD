# Project Description
This project is a duel homework assignment to teach how to get Pycharm setup with Docker, Flask, MySql. Modifications are made for Homework 5 with the use of https://simplemaps.com/data/us-cities which is where I got the data. I will be using the United States cities at a statistic for Homework 5.
